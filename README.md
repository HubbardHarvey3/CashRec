# ReconcileDonation
# Free software for small churches or nonprofits to utilize in order to reconcile their donation.
Thank you for downloading (Name Still Pending) the free Tool for use by Non-Profits Churches.
The tool is broken down into 3 tabs, 
1.	Donor List
2.	Transactions
3.	Balancing

# Getting Started
1. Download the repo onto your machine
2. Double Click on the CashRec.Exe file and the program will start up.

# Donor List Tab
The Donor List keeps track of a list of Donors.  You must choose a Unique Donor Number for each donor name you enter.
In order to add a Donor,
1.	Enter in a unique Donor #
2.	Enter in the First Name of the Donor
3.	Enter in the Last Name of the Donor
4.	Click the Submit button
5.	The newly entered Donor should appear on Donor List to the right

To delete an existing Donor,
1.	Enter in the Existing Donor’s #
2.	Click the Delete Button
3.	The Donor should disappear from the Donor List to the right

# Transactions Tab
The Transactions Tab allows you to record the daily donation from the Donors on your Donor List.

To add a single donation,
1.	Pick a date in the top box
2.	Enter in the Donor’s unique #
3.	Enter in amount of the donation in either the Check Amount or Cash Amount box
4.	Press Submit
5.	The Donation should appear in the table on the far right of the application.

To Delete a transaction
1.	Enter in the Donor # of the Donation you want to delete
2.	Enter in the corresponding Check/Cash Amount of the donation you want to delete
3.	Click the Delete Row button.
4.	The donation record should disappear from the table

To add up every donation record in the table, simply click the Total Button.  A message box will appear with the total donation as well as the breakdown by check or cash.
****Ensure you press the Total Button before navigating to the Balancing Tab****
In order to save your daily donation record, click the Export to CSV button after entering the donation records.  The application will create a CSV file and record the information you see in the table.  The file will be in the same directory you have installed the application under the filename DonationHistory.CSV.  If the csv file already exists when click the Export button is clicked, the application writes the donations in the grid to the bottom of the existing CSV file.

# Balancing Tab
The Balancing Tab helps the user ensure an accurate record of the days donation.
In order to balance the days donations
1.	The user will first have to click the Total Button on the Transaction Page
2.	Enter in the Check Amounts in the Check Amounts box.
a.	Enter in one check at a time and click the Submit button to add the check total to the grid directly to the right of the button
b.	To delete a check amount, ensure the check amount matches the check amount record on the table, and click delete
3.	Once you are finished entering your check amounts in, the two lower boxes will count how many checks you have and what they totaled to.
4.	The user has a balanced check amount when the Lowest Check Amount box matches the Check Total from the transaction screen located in the middle of the application window.
5.	Next, in order to balance Cash, the user enters in the quantity of the appropriate currency quantities.
6.	Once the appropriate currency quantities are entered, click the Total Cash button to calculate the Cash amount and ensure it matches the amount listed on the Cash Total from the transaction screen located in the middle of the application window.

Other notes
The CSV file can be read by several applications such as,
 	Microsoft Excel (Paid)
	Open Office (Free)
	Notepad (Free)
It is a sound practice to copy (not cut) the DonationHistory.CSV file to a backup storage device in case the application or computer crashes.  
Also, the Donor List is saved on a Text file called DonorList.txt which will be in the same directory as the application.  This file must remain untouched but can be copied and kept elsewhere for safe keeping.
